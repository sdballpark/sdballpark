## 📚 Current Focus Areas:
- Machine Learning (Classification, Regression, Anomaly Detection)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval
- Predictive Analytics and Risk Modeling
- Cloud-based Deployment (Google Cloud, Streamlit, Colab, Binder)

---

## 🚀 Featured Projects:
- 🏡 [Predict House Prices using Linear Regression](https://github.com/sdballpark/predict-house-prices)
- ⚡ [Real-Time Fraud Detection with Apache Spark](https://github.com/sdballpark/fraud-detection-spark)
- 📝 [Resume Matching NLP with Cosine Similarity](https://github.com/sdballpark/resume-matching-nlp)
- 🚀 [Logistic Regression from Scratch with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)](https://github.com/sdballpark/sgd-logistic-regression)

*(All projects are runnable live via Colab or Binder!)*
